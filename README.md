DribbbleClient
==============

The Dribbble client for iPhone will interact with the Dribbble API to present images from the Dribbble api. Also the app will revel more information when an image is tapped from the collection and information about the artist. Tapping the artist's name will revel more information abut the artist and a collection of other images from the artist.
